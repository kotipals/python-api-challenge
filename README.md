# python-api-challenge

In this challenge, we were asked to take a look at weather data and analyze how the weather is like when we get closer to the equator.
The analysis is located in the WeatherPy and the VacationPy files.

In the WeatherPy file, we use the citypy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to conduct our analysis and create a model of weather across cities. We use the weather data retrieved to create scatter plots and also regression lines, model formulas and r-values for the plots. 

In the VacationPy file, we use the geoViews Python library and the Geoapify API to plan future vacations.
